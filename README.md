## Intro
Forked from branch https://github.com/ayermolo/darkflow.git
to support yolov4 pb and onnx file generation from weights.

## Dependencies

Python3.6.1, tensorflow 1.14, numpy, opencv 3.

### Getting started

* Get [yolov4.cfg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/master/cfg/yolov4.cfg) - 245 MB: [yolov4.weights](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/releases/download/darknet_yolo_v3_optimal/yolov4.weights) (Google-drive mirror [yolov4.weights](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1cewMfusmPjYWbrnuJRuKhPMwRe_b9PaT) ) paper [Yolo v4](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10934)
    just change `width=` and `height=` parameters in `yolov4.cfg` file and use the same `yolov4.weights` file for all cases.
