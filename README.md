## Intro
Forked from branch https://github.com/ayermolo/darkflow.git
to support yolov4 pb file generation from weights.

## Dependencies

Python3.6.1, tensorflow 1.14, numpy, opencv 3.

### Getting started

Get yolov4.cfg https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/master/cfg/yolov4.cfg - 245 MB: https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/releases/download/darknet_yolo_v3_optimal/yolov4.weights  (Google-drive mirror yolov4.weights https://drive.google.com/open?id=1cewMfusmPjYWbrnuJRuKhPMwRe_b9PaT) paper Yolo v4 just change width= and height= parameters in yolov4.cfg file and use the same yolov4.weights file for all cases.
